;; --ex-144
;; Will sum and how-many work for NEList-of-temperatures
;; even though they are designed for inputs from
;; List-of-temperatures? If you think they don't work, provide
;; counter-examples. If you think they would, explain why.

;; Both those functions will work for NEList-of-temperatures
;; because all List-of-temperatures are NEList-of-temperatures.
;; NEList-of-temperatures is a subset of List-of-temperatures.
;; Now if it was the other way around, say these functions
;; were designed for NEList-of-temperatures, then they probably
;; won't have been designed to handle the empty list.
