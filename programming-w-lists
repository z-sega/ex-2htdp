;; Sample Problem
;; You are working on the contact list for some new cell
;; phone. The phone's owner updates and consults this list
;; on various occassions. For now, you are assigned the task
;; of designing a function that consumes the list of
;; contacts and determines whether it contains the name
;; "Flatt".

; - '()
; - (cons String List-of-names)
