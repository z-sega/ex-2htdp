;; ex-201
;; Design select-all-album-titles. The function consumes
;; an LTracks and produces the list of album titles as
;; a List-of-strings.
;;
;; Also design the function create-set. It consumes a
;; List-of-strings and constructs one that contains every
;; String from the given list exactly once.
;; *Hint* If String s is at the front of the given list
;; and occurs in the rest of the list, too, create-set does
;; not keep s.
;;
;; Finally design select-album-titles/unique, which consumes
;; an LTracks and produces a list of unique album titles.
;; Use this function to determine all album titles in your
;; iTunes collectiona and also find out how many distinct
;; albums it contains.
