;; Step through the evaluation of this expression:

((lambda (x) x) (lambda (x) x))
;; (lambda (x) x)

;; Now step through this one:

((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) x))
;; ((lambda (x) x) (lambda (x) x))
;; (lambda (x) x)

;; Stop! What do you think we should try next?
;; Yes, try to evaluate

((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (x x)))
;; ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (x x)))
;; ((lambda (x) (x x)) (lambda (x) (x x)))
