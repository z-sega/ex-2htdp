;; Design the prefixes function, which consumes a
;; list of 1Strings and produces the list of all
;; prefixes. A list p is a prefix of l if p and l
;; are the same up through all items in p.
;; For example, (list "a" "b" "c") is a prefix
;; of itself and (list "a" "b" "c" "d").
;;
;; Design the function suffixes, which consumes a
;; list of 1Strings and produces all suffixes. A
;; list s is a suffix of l if s and l are the same
;; from the end, up through all items in s.
;; For example, (list "b" "c" "d") is a suffix of
;; itself and (list "a" "b" "c" "d").
