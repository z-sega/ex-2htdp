;; *Sample Problem*
;; Given a word, find all words that are made up from
;; the same letters. For example "cat" also spells "act".


;; ex-210
;; Complete the design of the words->strings function specified
;; in fig. 78.
;; *Hint* Use your solution to ex-209

; A Word is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons 1String Word)
; *interpretation*
; a Word is a list of 1Strings (letters)
(define w-cat (list "c" "a" "t"))
(define w-dear (list "d" "e" "a" "r"))
  
; LWords is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons Word LWords)
(define lw1 (list w-cat w-dear))

;; Here are the wish-list entries:

; LStrings -> LStrings
; picks out all those Strings that occur in the dictionary.
(define (in-dictionary ls) '())

; LWords -> LStrings
; converts all Words in lw to Strings
(check-expect (words->strings '()) '())
