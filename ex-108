;; In its default state, a pedestrian crossing light
;; shows an orange person standing, on a black background.
;; When it is time to allow the pedestrian to cross the
;; street, the light receives a signal and switches to a
;; green, walking person. This phase lasts for 10 seconds.
;; After that the light displays the digits 9, 8, ..., 0
;; with odd numbers colored orange and even numbers colored
;; green. When the countdown reaches 0, the light switches
;; back to its default state.
;;
;; Design a world program that implements such a pedestrian
;; traffic light. The light switches from its default state
;; when you press the space bar on your keyboard. All other
;; transitions must be reactions to clock ticks. You may
;; wish to use the following images
;;
;; ...
;; or you can make up your own stick figures with the
;; 2htdp/image teachpack.
